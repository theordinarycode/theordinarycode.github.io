Making good progress learning react, and integrating firebase. Pushing to finish the inventroy app. About 60% there. Need to iron out the kinks, and deploy it, which will be a whole other issue, likely.

Planning to implement a virtural real estate scheme. Buy domains, and rank them. This should teach me about seo, sales, and create a decent portfolio opportunity.
