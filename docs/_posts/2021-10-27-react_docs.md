Working through the Reactjs.org docs. Challenging to absorb it. In tutorial hell as well.

Looking forward to tackle React Native and build a first app. Talking with AB about a "Passport" app, which should be a simple test. 

Simultaneously working on an NFT project. Creating Python code to make generative art from png layers. Working already, just need to add rarity.
